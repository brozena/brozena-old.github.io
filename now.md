I made a sweet return to State College, Pennsylvania after 10 years away. I live at the base of Mt Nittany in a cozy old apartment. I've been reconnecting with very old friends. I usually wake up early to write. Some in-progress stuff is online [here](https://publish.obsidian.md/brozena/).

I was recently admitted to do a PhD in Informatics at Penn State University. I begin fall 2021 under Dr Saeed Abdullah in the [Wellbeing and Health Innovation Lab](https://whilab.org/). I'll be researching [a computational framework to identify early warning signs of relapse](https://whilab.org/projects/bd-prediction.html) in bipolar disorder, ultimately aimed at creating supportive tools for early intervention and self-management of this illness.

I've also started an [Adult Children of Alcoholics](https://adultchildren.org) meeting online. We have a lively group that meets three nights per week, making use of family systems concepts in a 12-step group setting. I'm happy to say this has been helpful in a bunch of ways to a bunch of people during the pandemic.
