I'm living in State College, Pennsylvania, a sweet return after nearly 10 years away.

I'm currently doing a deep-dive into Python and time series analysis. Jake Vanderplas' [Python Data Science Handbook](https://github.com/jakevdp/PythonDataScienceHandbook) has been helpful. I'm working in the [WHI lab](https://whilab.org) on the bipolar disorder [relapse detection project](https://whilab.org/projects/bd-prediction.html).

This is in preparation for grad school in informatics. I'll focus on passive sensing & prediction of mood episodes, ideally to help reduce their harms early on.

During the pandemic, I started an [Adult Children of Alcoholics](https://adultchildren.org) meeting online. We have a lively group that meets three nights per week, making use of family systems concepts in a 12-step group setting. 

I've been writing most mornings. Some is online [here](https://notes.brozena.net).
