I made a sweet return to State College, Pennsylvania after 10 years away. I live at the base of Mt Nittany in a cozy old apartment. I've been reconnecting with very old friends. I usually wake up early to write. Some in-progress stuff is online [here](https://publish.obsidian.md/brozena/).

I'm currently doing a deep-dive into Python and time series analysis. Jake Vanderplas' [Python Data Science Handbook](https://github.com/jakevdp/PythonDataScienceHandbook) has been useful. I'm working in the [WHI lab](https://whilab.org) on the bipolar disorder [relapse detection project](https://whilab.org/projects/bd-prediction.html).

This is all in preparation for grad school in informatics. I plan on researching the passive sensing and prediction of mood episodes using HCI methods and data science. Ultimately I want to create supportive tools for early intervention and self-management of bipolar disorder. 

I've also started an [Adult Children of Alcoholics](https://adultchildren.org) meeting online. We have a lively group that meets three nights per week, making use of family systems concepts in a 12-step group setting. I'm happy to say this has been helpful in a bunch of ways to a bunch of people during the pandemic.
