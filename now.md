I [took the long way](/nobody-falls-halfway) back to State College, Pennsylvania after 10 years away so that I could pursue grad school. I live at the base of Mt Nittany in a cozy old apartment. I am very happy to call this place home again. 
 
In the fall of 2021 I started work on my [PhD in informatics](https://ist.psu.edu/prospective/graduate/phd-informatics) at Penn State advised by [Dr Saeed Abdullah](https://saeedabdullah.com) in the [Wellbeing and Health Innovation Lab](https://whilab.org/). I'll be researching a [computational framework to identify early warning signs of relapse](https://whilab.org/projects/bd-prediction.html) in bipolar disorder, ultimately aimed at creating collaborative, supportive tools for early intervention and management of this illness. I'm currently completing coursework related to human-computer interaction, privacy-preservation, and data science. 

I've started an [Adult Children of Alcoholics](https://adultchildren.org) meeting online. We have a lively group that meets three nights per week, making use of family systems concepts in a 12-step group setting. I'm happy to say this has been helpful in a bunch of ways to a bunch of people during the pandemic. Feel free to get in touch if this is interesting to you.
