Please

Don't forget the flight  
of sweetness and silence  
terrible lightness and sorrow  
into the widest deepest line.

Curves and outlines and contours   
remain where only colors burned  
so bright others turned away  
But we are so brave  

Make only meaning where there is loss  
depth where there is sadness  
We are the bittersweet giants  
who taste the gifts of god.
