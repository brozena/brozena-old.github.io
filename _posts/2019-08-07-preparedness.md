title: "Meditations on Preparedness"

Preparedness in two parts,

1. *practice*, which is an art and requires a tolerance for imperfection
2. *progress*, which requires self-honesty

If practice is the action of learning, I am learning *how* to learn later in life. Fine. My awareness has always been high, but my focus was scattered. Awareness is separate from concentration. Coupled with perfectionism, focused practice seemed impossible.

The relationship between progress and self-honesty is readiness. Preparedness.

With high levels of awareness, I can confidently spot opportunities. But without the required self-honesty, insight, to determine readiness, I eat crow. 

Less perfect practice means allowing mistakes without blindly practicing mistakes: How practice is an art.
