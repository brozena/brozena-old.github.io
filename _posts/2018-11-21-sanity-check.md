Over the last year of my life, I aspired to confirm past answers to hard questions as consciously and as completely as possible. As I wrote in [Cleaning a Beautiful Mess]({{ site.baseurl}}{% post_url 2013-10-23-cleaning %}), “you have to want it. You have to really want to get better.”

For the sake of clarity — the root question was not intended as a hedonistic unmedicated bender — but a true and honest inquiry into the full spectrum of available treatment options for the treatment of bipolar disorder..
