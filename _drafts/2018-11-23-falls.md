_The fear of heights is rational._

___

Over the last year of my life, I aimed to confirm past answers (_known-good medication treatments_) to hard questions (_living well with cross-generational bipolarity_) as consciously and as completely as I could. Having learned of the [micro-nutrient approaches](http://www.ibpf.org/advanced-nutrient-therapies-bipolar-disorders-dr-william-walsh) to mental illnesses, I attempted a full exploration into what it may take to lead a good life with this diagnosis.

What began with a deep dive into narratives of possible apocalypses ended with a controlled-burn of my own false selves, the necessarily-crafted personas of my teens and twenties.

I am offering this essay to document my own process. I aim to offer some hard-won truths in hopes that they help others along the way.

In the words of Robert Lowell, "Yet why not say what happened?" 

___

I honestly did not believe I was after the hedonism of "non-compliance."

Finally, after ten years of medication, I wanted to learn the full spectrum of available treatment options for bipolar disorder — especially those aiming towards the deeper (and seemingly many) root causes.

As Kay Redfield Jamison has written, the most exuberant of us require more shielding than others. And so,  I learn *again* that medicated life offers some of the required armor to manage myself as a highly-sensitive person in this world -- while loved ones in my life wait in worry for me to realize this perennial truth. 

**To be clear:** At no point did I reject the idea of a treatment plan, or that this was indeed my diagnosis. And I have seen with profound clarity that **although it is my job to determine who writes my treatment plan, I cannot personally be the one to write it.** Third-party observation and self-preservation are both requirements to manage this illness well.

**This is the wicked problem of maintaining awareness**, subjective discernment, between mild hypomania and desirable high performance: By the time the coals of hypomania are really simmering, objective self-observation becomes a full-time job. The power of seduction (and seduction of power) is too real.

In that regard, these words explore my hot take on a more nuanced understanding of “act of will.” With hypomania, increased agency -- the attendant powers that do grow with hypomania -- eventually devolve towards madness given enough time. This is the super bittersweet and most temporal quality of the illness. "I'm not yet mad."

**My energy during mild hypomania does tend to seduce.** It offers a sense of relief from depressive tendencies, a view from above so high that it appears to be the pure truth. Finally I feel the mask of depression slowly fall off and others are equally as intrigued by what they can see. Here may be the true self.

My intuition becomes faster and clearer than usual, and lord knows others want to finally see things from the perspective of heavenly-aboves. Maybe you have heard the stories of Uber’s god-view overlooking all cars at once. Naturally -- power and clarity are attractive, and here is where my human condition appears to expand even for a moment. 

However, I pay for today’s seduction with tomorrow’s irritability, anger, impatience. Unfortunately others can count these costs before me. I'm spending seduction while others are paying for irritability. There exists a speed limit to cognition and it appears to be Social (Consensus) Reality.

In my experience, *there are three acts to a good bout of hypomania*: 1) when it is unknown to others or to myself, 2) when it known to others but not yet myself, and 3) when I become aware of what others have known for months.

I will explore the thin line between ambition and grandiosity, which is to say the tensions between any false and true selves. I will simultaneously tell the story of my shared journey west -- and back east again. These two narratives are inextricably woven together.

I will do so in these three acts.

## Act One: The Sense of An Ending

I decided to move to New York City in November 2017 after spending the better part of 6 years commuting from Scranton, Pennsylvania to study [tabla](/tabla) with [Dan Weiss](http://www.danweiss.net). I would sometimes drive from Scranton to Brooklyn to get to a gig several times a week. On the way home I would sleep in my car to avoid exhaustion. I saw no other option.

In the words of Giovanni Giorgio on the Daft Punk track, **"I definitely wanted to become a musician. It was almost impossible because the dream was so big... I would partially sleep in the car
because I didn't want to drive home and that help me for about almost 2 years to survive."**

This was a gratifying moment that I had intentionally delayed since 2011 to allow a rare and meaningful apprenticeship under a friend-mentor to complete in Scranton, Pennsylvania. I am grateful to have met with implicit trust and the chance to accomplish so much over time at S4K. 

It is rare to work for so long alongside a person you trust, let alone to learn how to do so in the process.

_In the course of 10 years, we riffed on themes of serendipity and patterned mutual trust. Most of what I learned was imbibed through action, not words. So it goes._

___

In many senses of the word, I was prepared for the move. I certainly had the desire and drive to be in NYC, both compounding over several years. Gratefully, I had [close musical friends](http://www.samarthnagarkar.com) supporting me into new living and work arrangements. 

But I arrived feeling the itch of hypomania in my achilles heel.

Bottom line: Twice over the last two years, I was seduced by what could have evolved into total madness. Both times, I was interested in knowing my psychological baseline after many years of medication. For whatever my reasons, these events fall within somewhat predictable timetables for my diagnosis of bipolar type 2. 

My first inquiry was in summer of 2017, and I wanted to know how this medicine was impacting my body. My doctor had some routine bloodwork pulled and I resumed my previous course of treatment. Because I fasted from water, my cholesterol was read as high. Otherwise, things appeared just fine.

The second bout, during summer of 2018, I was after something different.

Although I had managed symptoms well for years with medication and meditation, my concern was less about what the city would do to me than what I would do to myself given the wrong conditions: **Sometimes self-harm comes, slowly, in the form of casual abandonment, of disassociating with consequences large or small, of forgetting that many others have no concept of the tight-rope heights that I can walk on at will.**

As I settled into my new living space, I already knew the city's population growth had greatly outpaced its infrastructure. But with my sensitive tentacles of awareness already on high-alert, hearing stories about single point-of-failure in the water supply's staging chambers and continually-offline subways flew right over my comfort-level.

Shortly after arriving, I became aware of Daniel Schmachtenbeger's episodes of	 the Future Thinkers podcast. Like many others, I remain enamored by his capacity to synthesize a universe of ideas that I had yet to be exposed to. I took an entire day -- a full 12 hours or so -- to explore what their group had published online.

Like many others, Daniel's articulation of existential risk profoundly extended thoughts I had been having for years. Having spent a few years reading on late/post-capitalist economics, AI safety, and systems dynamics in general, I was [strangely-attracted](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Attractor#Strange_attractor) to this eloquent mind.

Separately but in parallel, I had started researching micronutrient approach to ADHD symptoms. Having researched the topic for a few months, I began supplementing magnesium threonate.

Having learned next to nothing from the labs I had drawn a year ago, I quickly chose to taper from my prescribed meds (read: *wrote my own treatment plan*) to get a better feel for my own psychological baseline for a short period of time until I was able to have labs read that offered more precision. 

I am not very proud of this decision, would recommend it to precisely no one affected by this disorder, and am actively engaging the [feelings of guilt](https://www.theguardian.com/books/2013/apr/26/human-touch-in-bipolar-times) which commonly follow a bout of mania. [A man, an artist, a failure: Must Proceed.](http://www.graceguts.com/essays/the-tiny-room-the-jottings-of-e-e-cummings) ("so the necessity of proceeding applies to those who fail [or who make art] just as much as to those who succeed...")

For a moment, I lapsed into distrust that these medicines were in my own best interest. Regardless of whether this is true or false, I live a much more steady and socially-acceptable life by taking them.

Somewhere around May 2018, I listened to Schmachtenberger's [Collective Insights podcast episode](https://neurohacker.com/how-nutrient-based-psychiatry-is-revolutionizing-mental-health-with-dr-bill-walsh) with Dr Walsh. Roughly halfway through, Dr Heather Sandison and Dr Walsh begin discussing his recent research into [bipolarity's electrochemical nature](http://www.ibpf.org/advanced-nutrient-therapies-bipolar-disorders-dr-william-walsh).

I was on my daily 3-hour commute while listening, considering ways to improve how I was spending my time. Hearing Dr Walsh summarize this research, I knew I was about to make a radical move. 

I felt the rare but familiar gravitational tug of purpose which has [served](/tabla) my life well in the past. It was here that I made the decision that not only would I leave New York, but that I would put the Walsh Protocol [before the horse] at the center of my next endeavor.

_My view from the Kosciuszko Bridge before my departure._

In hindsight, I can recognize that this tug was, *separately*, amplified by bipolar hypomania itself. Speaking from experience, the ways hypomania begin to confound meaning are non-trivial. Additionally, they are impossibly subtle to detect without third-party clinical observation. With the half-life of psychiatric medication in my rear-view mirror, I became prone to these pesky tendencies.

Here is where I began my generous efforts to **stack the meaning** of micronutrient approaches to mental health with the possibility of working with Schmachtenberger's Neurohacker Collective. Naturally: I was already after the micronutrient approach to ADHD, Walsh had been researching bipolarity, Neurohacker was interviewing Walsh, and a friend was in San Diego working with Daniel's group.

Let me do a back-of-envelope equation of two forms of the above story. 

During a steady state of mind, the four items above come together like this this,

> `(ADHD micronutrient treatment) + (Walsh's bipolar research) +  (Neurohacker interviewed Walsh) + (friend near Neurohacker)`

In a hastened state of consciousness, it becomes,

> `(ADHD micronutrient treatment) * (Walsh's bipolar research) * (Neurohacker interviewed Walsh) * (friend near Neurohacker)`

Here is the inherent risk of shedding the capacity for discernment between subjective and objective reality, which is ultimately madness in a nutshell: **Without the desire for self-preservation, actualizing serendipity is a waste of energy.**

Meditating 2-3 hours daily just to keep my emotional balance, I realized the conditions of my current New York Stay may not meet the requirements for my lengthy New York Dream.

Near my 31st birthday in June and an hour into a meditation, I burst into tears when I turned my attention to the drumming buddha that Dan Weiss had offered to help me focus. 

I knew I had lost my footing after roughly 10 years averaging towards emotional steadiness, nearing the edge of relapse into an episode. And I intuitively knew that New York was not a safe place to live at the moment.

The meanings had been stacked too high.

## Act Two: Escape Hatch

I awoke one morning before my 31st birthday considering a question I was exposed to by my friend [Mark Reinhart](http://www.threepurerivers.com/) -- 

![Is it transcendance or escape?](/assets/similar.png)

My curiosity piques often, and when purposeful/gravitational curiosity comes along, I ride it.

Even in hindsight, I hold firm that I maintained adequate levels of [insight](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Insight#Psychiatry) and at no point put myself in harm's way.
