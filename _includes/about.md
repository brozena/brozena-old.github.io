## Speaking personally

**I'm Jeff**, a native Pennsylvanian fascinated by trees and people given a good ratio of the two. This site documents my process of living and working artfully.

I have some writing [here](/essays). **Start with [Nobody Falls Halfway](/nobody-falls-halfway/).**

I play drums and [tabla](/tabla/) and spend time between [New York](https://danweiss.net) and Pennsylvania to pursue this.

I practice Zen Buddhism at the [Endless Mountain Zendo](http://www.endlessmountainzendo.org) in Stillwater, PA. Lately I've also been attending local Quaker meetings in State College.

## Speaking professionally

Today I am nestled near Penn State where I am beginning graduate school in informatics. I am in the [Wellbeing and Health Innovation Lab](https://whilab.org) where I'm working on **[digital phenotyping](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digital_phenotyping) to detect relapse after first-episode psychosis.**

Previously, **I led the [digital transformation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digital_transformation)** of [Smiles4Keeps Pediatric Dentistry](https://www.smiles4keeps.com), one of the country's largest and highest-quality closely-held Medicaid groups. With minimal supervision and years of close mentorship by its owner, I stewarded the group from paper operations into a fully-integrated, centralized operating environment.
