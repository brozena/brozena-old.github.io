## Speaking personally

**I'm Jeff**, a native Pennsylvanian fascinated by trees and people given a good ratio of the two. Around here, I document my ongoing process of living and working artfully.

I play drums and [tabla](/tabla/) and spend time between New York and Pennsylvania to pursue this discipline.

I practice Zen Buddhism with the [Endless Mountain Zendo](http://www.endlessmountainzendo.org) in Stillwater, PA.

I write often, and some is published [here](/archives).

### A few of my favorite things

- Complexity science, complex adaptive systems
- Psychology, especially family systems theory & the healing of cross-generational trauma
- [Tabla](/tabla/), drums, breathing -- simultaneously when
possible


## Speaking professionally

I have worked for 7 years in the healthcare domain, aligning and integrating software to fit strategic business needs during sustained periods of rapid change. Throughout college, I worked as a software trainer. As I write on my [CV](http://cv.brozena.net),

> I am a teacher at heart with broad and deep experience at one of the country's largest and most respected privately-held Medicaid pediatric dental groups. I was trusted to set strategic direction, improve core business processes and lead complex change shortly before a cross-generational ownership transfer was expected. My impact at this group was described "like a crater" by its ownership. By engaging the parts while respecting the needs of the whole, I leveraged software as the catalyst for organizational improvement and the "shift of mind" required of the group to proceed into its next phase of growth.

For a more nuanced take on my work as a change agent at Smiles4Keeps Pediatric Dentistry, [Healing vs Fixing]({% post_url 2016-05-12-healing-vs-fixing %}) offers a subjective description of my less-technical accomplishments, however lasting. This and other strategic writing was distributed internally and catalyzed organizational changes.
