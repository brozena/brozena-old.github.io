## Speaking professionally

I am a first-year PhD student at Penn State University in the [Wellbeing and Health Innovation Lab](https://whilab.org) where I'm working on **[digital phenotyping](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digital_phenotyping) in psychiatry.** [Dr Saeed Abdullah](https://saeedabdullah.com) is my advisor.

Previously, **I led the [digital transformation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digital_transformation)** of [Smiles4Keeps Pediatric Dentistry](https://www.smiles4keeps.com), one of the country's largest and highest-quality closely-held Medicaid groups. With minimal supervision and years of close mentorship by its owner, I stewarded the group from paper operations into a fully-integrated, centralized operating environment.

## Speaking personally

I have some writing [here](/essays). **Start with [Nobody Falls Halfway](/nobody-falls-halfway/).**

I play drums and [tabla](/tabla/) and have spent time between [New York](https://danweiss.net) and Pennsylvania to pursue this.

I practice Zen Buddhism at the [Endless Mountain Zendo](http://www.endlessmountainzendo.org) in Stillwater, PA. Lately I've also been attending local Quaker meetings in State College.
