## Speaking personally

**I'm Jeff**, a native Pennsylvanian fascinated by trees and people given a good ratio of the two. This site serves to document my exploration of balancing artful living and work.

I play drums and [tabla](/tabla/) and spend time between New York and Pennsylvania to pursue this discipline.

Zen Buddhism remains an important part of my life, and I practice at the [Endless Mountain Zendo](http://www.endlessmountainzendo.org) in Stillwater, PA.

I write often, and some is published [here](/archives).

Throughout my 30s, I plan on pursuing graduate work in counseling psychology.

### A few favorite things

- Viktor Frankl's book *Man's Search for Meaning*
- Organizational structures, architectures & complex change management (e.g., Peter Senge's *The Fifth Discipline*)
- [Tabla](/tabla/), drums, biorhythms & breathing -- simultaneously when possible
- Family systems theory & the subject of healing cross-generational trauma (John Bradshaw)
- Complexity theory, complex adaptive systems

## Speaking professionally

I have worked for 7 years in the healthcare domain, aligning and integrating software to fit strategic business needs during sustained periods of rapid change. Throughout college, I worked as a software trainer. As I write on my [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/brozena) profile,

> I am a teacher at heart with broad and deep experience at one of the country's largest and most respected privately-held Medicaid pediatric dental groups. I was trusted to set strategic direction, improve core business processes and lead complex change shortly before a cross-generational ownership transfer was expected. My impact at this group was described "like a crater" by its ownership. By engaging the parts while respecting the needs of the whole, I leveraged software as the catalyst for organizational improvement and the "shift of mind" required of the group to proceed into its next phase of growth.

For a more nuanced take on my work as a change agent at Smiles4Keeps Pediatric Dentistry, [Healing vs Fixing]({% post_url 2016-05-12-healing-vs-fixing %}) offers a subjective description of my less-technical accomplishments, however lasting. This and other strategic writing was distributed internally and catalyzed organizational changes.
