## Speaking personally

**I'm Jeff**, a native Pennsylvanian fascinated by trees and people given a good ratio of the two. Around here, I document my ongoing process of living and working artfully.

I play drums and [tabla](/tabla/) and spend time between New York and Pennsylvania to pursue this discipline.

I practice Zen Buddhism with the [Endless Mountain Zendo](http://www.endlessmountainzendo.org) in Stillwater, PA.

I write often, and some is published [here](/essays). **Start with [Nobody Falls Halfway](/nobody-falls-halfway/).**

### A few of my favorite things

- Psychology, especially family systems theory
- [Tabla](/tabla/), drums, minimalism
- Complexity, complex adaptive systems

## Speaking professionally

Today I am nestled near Penn State where I am preparing for graduate school in information sciences. I am employed by the [Wellbeing and Health Innovation Lab](https://whilab.org) where I'm working on **[digital phenotyping](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digital_phenotyping) of bipolar disorder.**

Previously, **I led the [digital transformation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digital_transformation)** of [Smiles4Keeps Pediatric Dentistry](https://www.smiles4keeps.com), one of the nation's largest and highest-quality closely-held Medicaid groups. With minimal supervision and years of close mentorship by its owner, I stewarded the group from paper operations into a fully-integrated, centralized operating environment.
