_I don't always finish what I pick up, and I certainly don't pick up everything I collect. But by logging it all, I remember where I've been and maybe see where I'm going next._

I listen to electronic text using synthetic text-to-speech at a fairly high rate of speed. This allows me to complete most books in around three hours.

I have a feeling that my comprehension & retention of text at this speed comes with years of listening to solo [tabla](/tabla) which has a quick linguistic quality. My ears are faster than my eyes.

The above is true for non-fiction, which is most of what I read. I tend to stick to paper for fiction or poetry when I'm feeling slower.

To make this work, I
* buy a copy of the ebook,  
* import it into [Calibre](https://calibre-ebook.com/) where I keep things organized and in an [open](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/EPUB) format,
* play it back using [Voice Dream Reader](https://www.voicedream.com/reader/). Any bookmarking or notes flow through Voice Dream and out as plaintext.
