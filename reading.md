_I don't always finish what I pick up, and I certainly don't pick up everything I collect. But these logs are my way of following my own interests over time to remember where I've been and maybe to see where I'm going next._

I listen to electronic text using synthetic text-to-speech at a fairly high rate of speed. This allows me to complete most books in 2 hours or so.

I have a feeling that I can comprehend and retain text at this speed after years of listening to solo [tabla](/tabla), which have a very quick linguistic quality. My ears are faster than my eyes.

This is true for non-fiction, which is most of what I read. I tend to stick to paper for fiction or poetry when I'm feeling slower.

To make this work, I
* buy a copy of the book,  
* import it to [Calibre](https://calibre-ebook.com/) where I keep things organized and in an [open](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/EPUB) format,
* play it back using [Voice Dream Reader](https://www.voicedream.com/reader/). Any bookmarking or notes flow through Voice Dream and out as plaintext.
