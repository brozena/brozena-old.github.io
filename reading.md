_I don't always finish what I pick up, and I certainly don't pick up everything I collect. But I do log it all so I can work with texts, search them, visualize what I've read._

I listen to ebooks using fast, synthetic text-to-speech. I have a feeling that my comprehension & retention at this rate comes with years of listening to solo [tabla](/tabla) which has a quick linguistic quality. My ears are faster than my eyes.

To make this work, I
* buy an ebook, or [compile](https://epub.press/) web reads into an ebook
* import it into [Calibre](https://calibre-ebook.com/) where I keep things organized and in an [open](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/EPUB) format,
* play it back using [Voice Dream Reader](https://www.voicedream.com/reader/). I mark interesting paragraphs to come back to later, which get stored as plaintext and exported into my digital notes.

The above is true for non-fiction, which is most of what I read. I tend to stick to paper for fiction, poetry, when I need to move slower.
