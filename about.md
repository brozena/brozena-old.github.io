A few things I love,

- Viktor Frankl's writing
- [Endless Mountain Zendo](http://www.endlessmountainzendo.org)
- Systems, complexity theory
- Org development & complex change management
- Tabla, drums, biorhythms, breathing -- mostly concurrently
- Family systems theory & cross-generational trauma, epigenetics

I write to learn what my own voice sounds like, otherwise it's difficult for me to hear.
