### Speaking personally

A native Pennsylvanian who values trees and people given the correct ratio of the two. I sometimes publish essays and poetry primarily to document my process of growth and understanding of artful living, professional work, and the balanced relationship between the two.

I play drums and [tabla](/tabla/) and spend time between New York and Pennsylvania to pursue this discipline.

Zen Buddhism remains an important part of my life, and I practice at the [Endless Mountain Zendo](http://www.endlessmountainzendo.org) in Stillwater, PA.

I also write often, some of which is published on this site. 

Throughout my 30s, I plan on pursuing graduate work in counseling psychology.

#### A few favorite things

- Viktor Frankl's writing
- Organizational structures, architectures & complex change management
- [Tabla](/tabla/), drums, biorhythms & breathing -- concurrently when possible
- Family systems theory & the subject of healing cross-generational trauma
- Complexity theory, complex adaptive systems

### Speaking professionally

I worked for 7 years integrating and aligning software to fit strategic business needs during periods of rapid growth in the healthcare domain. Throughout college, I worked for 5 years as a software trainer. As I write on my [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/brozena) profile,

> I am a teacher at heart with broad and deep experience at one of the country's largest and most respected privately-held Medicaid pediatric dental groups. I was trusted to set strategic direction, improve core business processes and lead complex change shortly before a cross-generational ownership transfer was expected. My impact at this group was described "like a crater" by its ownership. By engaging the parts while respecting the needs of the whole, I leveraged software as the catalyst for organizational improvement and the "shift of mind" required of the group to proceed into its next phase of growth.

For a more nuanced take on my work at Smiles4Keeps Pediatric Dentistry, [Healing vs Fixing]({% post_url 2016-05-12-healing-vs-fixing %}) offers a subjective description of my less-technical accomplishments, however lasting. This and other strategic writing was distributed internally and catalyzed organizational changes.
